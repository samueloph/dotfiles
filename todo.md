1. schedule schroot auto updates
1. install snap packages: dbeaver-ce, spotify, codium (code)
1. gnome add shortcut to "open terminal"
1. gnome disable alt tab windows grouping (possibly the default now)
1. gnome show battery percentage and enable hot corner
1. gnome install and enable gpaste and system monitor extensions
1. gnome install paperwm
1. fix failure to update .bashrc when there's a new debian release (changing stable_codename on setup_debian.sh is not enough and rerunning the script will not update .bashrc, the check needs to be smarter)
1. configure msmt (and caff) with d.o and gmail
1. gnome 42 has a new setting for dark mode
1. colorful manpages (probably with "most")
